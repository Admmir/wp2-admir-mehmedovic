      title: "Scientists Discover New Exoplanet in Habitable Zone",
      content: `Astronomers have discovered a new Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could potentially exist on the surface.
  
  The planet, named TOI-700 e, is the fourth planet discovered in the TOI-700 system and is about 95% the size of Earth. It orbits a small, cool M dwarf star about 100 light-years away in the constellation Dorado.
  
  "This is one of the few systems with multiple, small, habitable-zone planets that we know of," said Emily Gilbert, the lead researcher. "This makes the TOI-700 system an exciting prospect for additional follow-up."`,
